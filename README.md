3D slide decks are so 2011. We need stuff that's _actually_ new and useful, such as:

* In-browser slide editing with markdown.
* Serve your presentation straight from your browser. No more remote web servers, no deploys.
* Tablet friendliness. Because I want to create a slide deck from my phone
as much as I want to stab myself in the eye with a rusty spoon.

# Inspiration

The idea for this app came out of two things: the fact I found myself not willing to get a slide deck going with the usual browser deck tools that are around (read: roll an HTML doc, hook the lib in, ), because lazy.

And from seeing [socrates.io][http://socrates.io] nailing a really good UI for writing in browser.
